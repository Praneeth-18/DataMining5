## Introduction
In this repository, we provide a comprehensive guide to analyzing an image dataset, followed by clustering and predictive modeling using Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). The dataset in question contains images from two categories: "Kirmizi_Pistachio" and "Siirt_Pistachio".

## Initial Exploration and Visualization
- **Objective**: Understand the basic properties of the dataset.
- **Output**: Initial statistics, such as the number of images in each category.

## Feature Extraction with MobileNetV2
- **Objective**: Convert high-dimensional image data into a feature set using a pre-trained model.
- **Output**: Features for each image that are suitable for clustering and modeling.

## Clustering and Anomaly Detection
- **Objective**: Group similar images and detect anomalies.
- **Output**: Clusters of images and a list of potential outliers.

## Building Models with H2O's AutoML
- **Objective**: Use AutoML to select the best model and hyperparameters.
- **Output**: A leaderboard displaying the performance of various models on the validation set.

## Conclusion
This repository offers a systematic approach to handling image datasets. From initial exploration to predictive modeling, a range of machine learning techniques are covered. This pipeline can be adapted for various datasets and provides a strong foundation for more complex tasks.
